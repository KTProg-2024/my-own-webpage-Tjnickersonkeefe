    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>Hey! I'm a freshman at Keefe Tech, hoping to learn more about programming. I was born in Brooklyn, New York, but raised in Massachusetts. My hobbies include mainly programming and gaming, but I like to make chocolate as well. <br>
    I have three cats, one dog, and two turtles. My favorite vacation spot is Pleasant Pond in Caratunk, Maine. Riding a towable behind the boat there is some of the most fun I've ever had.</p>
